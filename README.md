# ADOPTING MULTI-CLOUD STRATEGY WITH DOCKER AND KUBERNETES
This project focuses on implementing a multi-cloud strategy to deploy applications seamlessly across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. By leveraging multiple cloud providers, the solution ensures flexibility, scalability, and high availability while avoiding the risks of vendor lock-in, enabling organizations to achieve consistent performance and reliability across platforms.
Key tools integrated into the system include Terraform for infrastructure as code, Helm for Kubernetes deployment management, and Istio for service mesh. These tools enhance inter-service communication, improve security, and optimize resource utilization, while enabling dynamic scaling and reducing operational complexity. The project is designed to streamline cross-cloud operations and support efficient and secure application management.
